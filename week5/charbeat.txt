TC 349 - Client Side Web Development Week 5 - Charbeat Critique	Upon my first visit to the website "Charbeat," I was surprisingly unaware of what the site was actually used for. I've never heard of the company prior to this assignment, so it took me a few minutes to actually decipher what I was looking at. Right away, I thought the description was lacking. I see they have a title describing "Real-time data," but that can be quite useless for someone who doesn't know what that is upon first glance. After looking at the site a little while longer, I really began to appreciate its overall design. It is extremely engaging the way the graphing points lead you down the page as well as the different sections being clearly defined horizontally by color scheme. This keeps the webpage looking very organized and professional. 	Something I enjoy very much about this site is the free demo it lets it's users try while browsing. I think that is essential with this kind of service so that the buyers know exactly what they are getting for their money, along with the free 30-day trial button, which is nicely labeled in the header. At the bottom of the webpage, there are links provided and descriptions of different services the company provides, which is a convenient tool for more advanced users. There is also a clearly organized table of links in the footer of the page that provide all the information a visitor of this page could need. I believe the site overall, is extremely well designed and accurate. I also believe that listing the major companies that the website has provided service for really gives the website reliability.
