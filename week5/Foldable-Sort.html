<p>	After taking some time to learn about the technique of Card Sorting, I put this work to the test for the website of Foldable.me. I broke up the existing webpage into catagories and organized them out on a table in front of me using index cards. Before actually examining the current layout, I arranged my cards to show how I would initially design the layout of the page. After doing this process a few times, making minor adjustments and also examining how a few others would arrange the cards, I came to the conclusion of a very simplistic layout. The content that is being arranged on this page is not content of high importance or urgency, but just to have a good time making a craft. The craft in itself is quite simplistic, as there is not much to it. Therefore, I would believe a user browsing this page would adhere better to a simple, organized and neatly designed page, which can be found in my image above.</p>
<p>The people I chose to arrange the cards to their choosing, leaned towards a layout that was slightly off-balanced. I knew this upon glancing at their finished products. Each explained to me that they where attempting to make the design of the webpage more exciting, but because they have never worked in design before, this seemed to really offset the balance of the page. The layout I designed is different from the actual page of the site, but displays the same content. I noticed the site uses many horizontal columns to arrange their content, so to make this a bit better and a little more user friendly, I took some of the elements and aligned them vertically to balance the page. I also split the video footage into two parts, that way any footage will be quick, simple and to the point. The only element I chose to leave exactly as is, was the footer. It holds valuable content that I find to be best found at the bottom of the webpage. </p>
