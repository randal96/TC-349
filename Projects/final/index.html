The city consists of five boroughs, The Bronx, Brooklyn, Manhattan, Queen, and Staten Island. New York City is the most linguistically diverse city in the world and homes approximately 50 million visitors annually. Times Square, also known as "The Crossroads of the World," located in downtown Mathattan happens to be the center of the Great White Way and one of the busiest intersections in the world. New York City has become well known, as it functions as a capital for Wall Street, Central Park, Columbia University and NYU, Chinatown, Rockefeller Center, the Statue of Liberty and Columbus Circle. With all this and much much more, there is definitely a reason New York City is called, "The City that Never Sleeps."
