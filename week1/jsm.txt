TC 349 Client Side Web DevelopmentWriting: JSM critique 	The website used for graphic artist Jason Santa Maria is initially bland to the eye, but with a plethora of content.  Although such website may seem like a weak design, there are many features the designer uses that compliment his site. The content is set up nicely and organized in columns and chronological order. A clear toolbar at the head of the webpage allows for simple browsing and navigating from page to page. A filter is enabled at the top of pages with a heavy amount of content, so if the reader is looking for something specific their outcomes in search are more direct. Also, on the bottom of the pages, a black box of quick links, a search bar, contact information and information about Jason Santa Maria is listed. I find this to be somewhat essential in the creation of a good website, as most people browsing the web are looking for precise information and this attribute can quickly lead them there on a personal page. 	The color tones of this website are what seem to make the site “boring,” but they also provide great readability and that is quite important. If the viewer of the site cannot read the content well or they are overwhelmed by clashing color choices it could cause them to quickly close your page.  I enjoy what this website has to offer, because not only does the designer share much information about his work and himself, but he posts interesting articles and stores of people and other things related to his line of work. As stated, the site in itself is not exactly interesting, but perhaps less is more in Jason Santa Maria’s case. The content is there, it is very well organized and it has a modern artistic feel to it. I conclude it is a well done website overall.
