Client Side Web Design - TC 349
Week 1 - Writing - DEV Environments

	After taking the time to explore a few different dev environments, I have chosen to focus on Dreamweaver. Dreamweaver is not only the most familiar platform to me personally, but it looks to be the most inviting for both beginner and more advanced users in web design. Upon first glance of the program, I observe a quite simplistic setup for managing sites, creating folders, attaching style sheets and so on. I also really enjoy the on screen tool bar that allows you to easily switch between code, split and design views based on your preference. I find the automatic coloring while writing out the css stylesheet to be very helpful because it makes troubleshooting less difficult incase of error. You can clearly see where mistakes were made, even if it is as simple as leaving out a semi-colon. Small errors like this can make all the difference, especially when you are working with many lines of coding. 

	Dreamweaver also makes creating absolute and relative links quite simple as you can drag the target directly to the files in your folders. You can also directly write out the URL's for links. I prefer having all of my files, folders and individual html pages titled so they can be easily found and remain orderly. The side bar to the right of the main screen clearly displays all the working folders and what is in each of them. The last property that really causes me to prefer working in Dreamweaver is the quick publication directly to the web. 

	There is a lot more I'd like to learn about Dreamweaver, as I know it is one of the main editing programs for website designing. I am just a beginner myself, so I definitely have a lot to learn. This program looks to be quite extensive with many different functions and tools to learn and eventually put to use. When I began work in website design, the coding, programs and multi-step functions were intimidating to say the least, but Dreamweaver gives a clean platform and user friendly interface to make the learning process a better experience. I wouldn't say I am uncomfortable using other dev environments, but I would definitely choose Dreamweaver for these reasons over the latter.
