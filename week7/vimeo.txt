TC 349 – Client Side Web Development Week 7 – Vimeo Critique	Vimeo.com is a website that I am quite familiar with due to work here at Michigan State, though I wouldn’t be if it was on my own terms. Having worked with the site before, in uploading videos and other content, there are a few issues I come across.  The first element of Vimeo that I find uninviting is the layout and overall graphic design of the site. There is an overwhelming amount of content on the main page in addition to being extremely unorganized. My eyes simply don’t know where to look upon first glance at the page and even whilst scrolling down through the text and images. The color scheme and layouts seem to change with this site fairly frequently, though at the moment it is hard to tell if the designers planned a strategic way of displaying their material. It more looks as though they had so much information, they did their best to squeeze it in its entirety into too small of an area.	Many people would compare Vimeo to a major hosting site like YouTube, though I do not believe it has the professionalism or user ability to compete. If a user were looking for a lesser-known site to upload their videos, then perhaps Vimeo would be a good fit for them. Though as mentioned, they would have to really adapt to a confusing and quite cluttered website.  The last critique I would make about the site, is the bars that allow you to enter content, for example when you join the site. The text is very large and it doesn’t resemble a site that is of quality. The graphics make it look as though it is a site aimed for children. Overall, I don’t have much good to say about the layout/content design of Vimeo, though perhaps with some heavy changes in these, the site would come out a little more enjoyable to the user.
