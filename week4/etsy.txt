TC 349 – Client Side Web Development Week 4 Writing – Etsy 	I believe the website of Etsy to be quite poorly designed. Upon first glance at the homepage,  as a first time visitor I would be slightly confused as to what I was actually browsing. I would ask myself, what kind of shopping website is this? Is it official? Is this amateur made? I just wouldn’t know the answers to these questions seeing as there is no direct description of the content or business itself. 	The sections of the website themselves are not too badly organized. They seem to be broken into categories of interest or username. This would allow for easier browsing, but still seems a little chaotic, as there are so many users of this site trying to sell their products. The color scheme of the website is quite bland, but overall it is effective and readable which is most important. 	What I find to be a nice asset to this website is the fact that it allows its users to register. There is a simple navigation bar on the top of the page where the user can log on, register, make a search or view their cart. It doesn’t sound like it would be an essential element to a webpage, but for a site that is based upon sales and searches it is key. The designs of the pages are nicely labeled, with hover tags and columns. I do commend the pages for their organization. The website may not be a real visionary, but if you know what you are looking for and can handle the process of searching, on top of knowing what the website is actually used for, then it is overall an adequate site.
