TC 349 – Client Side Web Development Writing – Week 11 – rascalflatts.com	A site that I visit almost daily is the band website of Rascal Flatts. The site gives fans information about the band such as news, events, bios, photos and additional access for members of the fan club. I really love the design of this site, as they use a lot of JavaScript and elements of motion, pictures interchanging, scrolling news feeds and updates from social networking websites. The color scheme of the site is appealing and the overall design is very user friendly. 	As for the mobile design of this particular site, it is quite similar to our original recipes file before we were asked to make the changes. The site has an overall fixed width so you are able to view the entire site in the screen. The problem with this is that on mobile devices that is quite hard to read. You must zoom in to even be able to decipher the wording as well as zoom in to be able to click on a link. The great part about their site on mobile devices is that it is identical to their online site, so everything is constantly up to date. Another perk of this site is that upon a users first visit, a pop up appears on the screen to ask if you would like to download the free mobile app. The mobile app is definitely more user friendly than the website, which I would have to assume is why there hasn’t been much work done to the actual mobile version of the site.
