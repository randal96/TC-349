<h2>Panic.com Critique:</h2>
<p>Panic.com is a website that I believe to be effective, but lacking for a user who is unfamiliar with the companies products. It doesn't provide enough information to bring in new business ventures. Clients must have prior knowledge of what each product entails. Though on the contrary, the website in itself is simplistic and overall effective for returning users.

<br>
	The graphics on the webpage are quite large and appealing to the eye, though they only show the products logo. This does not provide the user of any information about each application. Some users upon initial browsing, may not even know that these products are computer applications until they take the time to scroll over each individual graphic. Personally, I feel the large graphics make the presentation of the webpage look juvenile, almost like a childs picture book. It makes it seem as though the company lacks integrity and professionalism.</p>
