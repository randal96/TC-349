TC 349 Ð Client Side Web Development
Writing Week 3 Ð MSU Critique

	The homepage for Michigan State University I believe is incredible well designed. The colors are reflective of the schools pride, everything looks structured and the overall layout of the website is engaging. There are clear-cut navigation bars to direct the person browsing to their areas of interest as well as a convenient search bar at the top of the page. This allows for searches by keyword and also displays popular search ideas. The blocks located through the center of the page lend bold titles such as news and events. These are captivating to the eye and will most likely give the readers of the website key information about recent events of the school. 

	At the bottom of the webpage, there are social media images providing links to those specific websites as well as links supporting official information from MSU such as how to contact and the privacy statement. The JavaScript on the website allows for the movement of pictures and graphics to flow in and off of the page. This gives the feeling of excitement and shows the people browsing the page a little bit more about what MSU has to offer. I really find the design of MSUÕs homepage to be extremely effective and thought out. It has a good amount of information and tools without obtaining the look of a cluttered page. Most importantly, the website is professional and it has great readability and navigation. This site would be a site I would hope to see if I was looking for an organized and innovative university to research. It would be easy to turn away from a school website that has unclear information or lacking a proper website because in most cases, it is the first introduction to a school a future student has.
